# gswProjectD3


In this project I was experimenting with creating some basic bar and donut graphs with D3.
Some of the examples
I hacked together from other works.

The first example is a basic bar chart.

The second example is a donut chart that displays
more data when hovering over a part of the donut.

the third example is another bar chart where a user can
 change the data and see the scores for other games.
